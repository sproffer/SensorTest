Android sensors - accelerometer and magnetometer

In addition to understand concepts of accelerations and orientations (azimuth/pitch/roll), there are 2 practical dumb usages: 
<b>Leveling tool</b>: lay your phone flat on a surface, if the surface is perfectly leveled, you should have reading of 
X and Y to be <i>0</i>, and Z to be <i>9.8</i>; <b>Compass</b>: lay your phone on a surface, top edge of your phone is pointing to Magnetic North when the reading of Azimuth is <i>0</i>.
